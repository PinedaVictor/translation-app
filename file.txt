Pure functional languages have this advantage: all flow of data is made explicit.
And this disadvantage: sometimes it is painfully explicit.
A program in a pure functional language is written as a set of equations.
Explicit data flow ensures that the value of an expression depends only on its
free variables. Hence substitution of equals for equals is always valid, making
such programs especially easy to reason about. Explicit data flow also ensures
that the order of computation is irrelevant, making such programs susceptible
to lazy evaluation.
It is with regard to modularity that explicit data flow becomes both a blessing
and a curse. On the one hand, it is the ultimate in modularity. All data in
and all data out are rendered manifest and accessible, providing a maximum of
flexibility. On the other hand, it is the nadir of modularity. The essence of an
algorithm can become buried under the plumbing required to carry data from
its point of creation to its point of use.
